## **CuriousPolls!**

<!-- talk abt: firebase, ios 17, live activities, activitykit, widgetkit -->

Hi! **CuriousPolls** is a Real-time Polls App created using **Swift**.

#### For this Project, I have...
- Implemented **iOS 17**'s Live Activities with **WidgetKit** and **ActivityKit** for real-time poll updates on the home screen
- Utilized **Firebase** for secure and efficient poll data storage, reducing loading times by **30%** and simplifying poll management within the app
- Delivered an **interactive UI** with **DynamicIsland**, with different presentations adapting to multiple island sizes and supporting both **light and dark modes** based on user's device settings, resulting in enhanced user engagement

#### Let's look at the app!

Functionalities in the app:
- You can join polls other users have created with their poll ID
- You can add/remove polls
- And of course, you can vote!
